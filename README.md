# CISS_Coulomb Interaction

The notebooks "OnsagerCasimir_HartreeFock_Github.ipynb" and "OnsagerCasimir_HubbarOneApproximation_Github.ipynb" serve as verification of Onsager-Casimir reciprocity. It is checked if the transmission satisfies time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation at equilibrium in both the Hartree-Fock and Hubbard One Approximation.


With "Helical_HartreeFockV0_LinMix.ipynb" and "Helical_HubbardOneV0_LinMix.ipynb", you can:
1. Calculate the electron density as a function of bias voltage
2. Calculate the magnetocurrent as a function of bias voltage.
3. Plot the "P-value" as a function of bias voltage. 


In the  Hubbard One and Hartree-Fock Approximation respectively.

The jupyter notebooks in "JupyterNotebooks_Coulomb" work together with the Modules in "Modules_Coulomb_Github". Therefore make sure you import the correct path.
