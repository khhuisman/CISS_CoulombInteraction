# CISS_Coulomb Interaction
# The jupyter notebooks in "CISS_CoulombInteraction" work together with the Modules in "Coulomb_Modules"

# The Onsager-Casimir notebooks serve as verification of time-reversal symmetry at equilibrium in both the Hartree-Fock and Hubbard One Approximation


# With "Helical_HubbardOne_Trapezoid_github.ipynb" and "Helical_HartreeFock_Trapezoid_github.ipynb",
# you can calculate the electron density and the magnetocurrent as a function of bias voltage.
