# CISS_Coulomb Interaction
The jupyter notebooks in "CISS_CoulombInteraction" work together with the Modules in "Coulomb_Modules_Github"

The Onsager-Casimir notebooks serve as verification of time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation at equilibrium in both the Hartree-Fock and Hubbard One Approximation


With "Helical_HartreeFockV0_LinMix.ipynb" and "Helical_HartreeFock_Trapezoid_github.ipynb", you can:
1. Calculate the electron density as a function of bias voltage
2. Calculate the magnetocurrent as a function of bias voltage.
3. Plot the "P-value" as a function of bias voltage.
In the  Hubbard One and Hartree-Fock Approximation respectively.
